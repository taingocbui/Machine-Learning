My team includes me, Tai Bui, and Caleb Joseph. Caleb is responsible to work with the theoretical part of the homework while I work with the coding problems. 

For my coding solutions, there are six different functions, not including the given load function for each data set. 

The sigmoid function takes in a numpy array and returns the sigmoid of each element of the array. 

The prob function takes in two vectors and return the sigmoid function of the dot product of the two vectors. 

The loss function takes in a weight vector, a y label vector and a 2 dimensions matrix X. This function return the value of the loss function.

The logistic_regression function takes in a w_init vector of initial weight with each elements are random generated values, a learning rate value ep,
2-dim matrix X, label vector y and a threshold value as parameters. This function returns a weight vector as a result of logistic regression.

The predict function takes in 2 matrix including training and test matrix. This function returns a list of prediction for each data element of the test matrix given their features.

Lastly, the accuracy_score function will returns the accuracy score of the logistic regression.

For this homework, I used Jupyter notebook to code. For Jupyter notebook, I do not need to use classes to run, therefore, I did not put all the functions under one single class.
Please let me know if you need me to make any adjustment.
