		Use keyword arguments to store parameters

		10 units, and 3 output nodes your initalization might look
		something like this:

		neural_net = Classifier(weights = [], num_input=30, num_hidden=10, num_output=3)

		Here I have the weight matrices being stored in a list called weights (initially empty).

		based on classifier_type. E.g. if you had a module called
		neural_nets:

		if self.classifier_type == 'neural_net':
			import neural_nets
			neural_nets.train_neural_net(self.params, training_data)

		Note that your training algorithms should be modifying the parameters
